# Data Science week 1:

This is the first week of Data Science Practical course. It comprises tutorials on:

- How to install the different softwares/ packages
- An overview of what *Data Science* is... Files can be found in `resources/Pratical Data Science.pptx` and in `resources/Practical Data Science.docx` on this prepository.
- An introduction to `Python` programming
- A tutorial on `Numpy`, a useful library for numerical computations
- A data visualization tool, `Matplotlib`
- A very important library for data manipulation, exploration, explanation and visualization library, `pandas`.
- A quick look on what `scipy` library is. This is particularly for those who already have a solid background in Mathematics or Physics.
- And finally, in the **gitdemo** folder, a tutorial on how to get used to `git` basic commands and how `GitHub` works.


## What you'll need:

>anaconda == 4.8.3 or any later version

Anaconda package should be enough to follow and run all the files listed here. And we will be using a `Jupyter notebook`, which also comes with anaconda. 

>`git clone <repository-url>`

For example:

`git clone https://github.com/Hamidou16/Data-Science-week1.git` 

This will clone this repository in your local machine.
